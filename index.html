        JSDoc is a markup language used to annotate JavaScript source code
        files. Using comments containing JSDoc, programmers can add
        documentation describing the application programming interface of the
        code they're creating.

        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
        front-end JavaScript library[3][4] for building user interfaces based on
        components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community
        of individual developers and companies.

        Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced "view"[4]) is an
        open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for
        building user interfaces and single-page applications.[10] It was
        created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active
        core team members.

      <p>
        Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+")[4] is a TypeScript-based,
        free and open-source single-page web application framework led by the
        Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and
        corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that
        built AngularJS.

      <h2>Svelte</h2>

      />
      <p>
        Svelte is a free and open-source front end component framework[4] or
        language[5] created by Rich Harris and maintained by the Svelte core
        team members.[6] Svelte is not a monolithic JavaScript library imported
        by applications: instead, Svelte compiles HTML templates to specialized
        code that manipulates the DOM directly, which may reduce the size of
        transferred files and give better client performance.[7] Application
        code is also processed by the compiler, inserting calls to automatically
        recompute data[4] and re-render UI elements when the data they depend on
        is modified.[8] This also avoids the overhead associated with runtime
        intermediate representations, such as virtual DOM,[9] unlike traditional
        frameworks (such as React and Vue) which carry out the bulk of their
        work at runtime, i.e. in the browser.
